<h1>Society Planning App</h1>

Welcome to our society planning application, here you are able to navigate to other pages using the buttons,
These buttons will allow you to view a list of upcoming events put on by various societies.
You can also see which events you have saved and would like to attend by using the calendar page.
Society event coordinators can create a post about one of their upcoming events as well as access a list
of contact details for local venues and facilities.

As this is the home page for the app, all other pages can be accessed from here and all have a button to
return to this page.
